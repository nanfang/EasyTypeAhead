# EasyTypeAhead
Statue: MVP done.

A web service for type-ahead or autocomplete feature. 

It is inspired by my recent job hunting during COVID-19, because I was interviewed by this question twice in one month. I just rushed a workable application based on what I rambled in the System Design interviews.
